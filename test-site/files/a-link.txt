  I'm creating a link to
  <a
    href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
    title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
          mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>



Moving down into subdirectories: If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside index.html (the top level index.html) pointing to projects/index.html, you would need to go down into the projects directory before indicating the file you want to link to. This is done by specifying the directory's name, then a forward slash, then the name of the file. The URL you would use is projects/index.html:

<p>Visit my <a href="projects/index.html">project homepage</a>.</p>


Copy to Clipboard
Moving back up into parent directories: If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside projects/index.html pointing to pdfs/project-brief.pdf, you'd have to go up a directory level, then back down into the pdfs directory. To go up a directory, use two dots — .. — so the URL you would use is ../pdfs/project-brief.pdf:
<p>A link to my <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf">project brief</a>.</p>



It's possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document, known as a document fragment, rather than just to the top of the document. To do this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you want to link to. It normally makes sense to link to a specific heading, so this would look something like the following:

<h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>
Copy to Clipboard
Then to link to that specific id, you'd include it at the end of the URL, preceded by a hash/pound symbol (#), for example:

<p>
  Want to write us a letter? Use our
  <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.
</p>


You can even use the document fragment reference on its own to link to another part of the current document:

<p>
  The <a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a> can be found at the
  bottom of this page.
</p>


If you're on a low bandwidth connection, click a link, and then a multiple megabyte download starts unexpectedly.
If you don't have the Flash player installed, click a link, and then suddenly get taken to a page that requires Flash.
Let's look at some examples, to see what kind of text can be used here:

<p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">
    Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/video-stream/" target="_blank">
    Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/car-game">
    Play the car game (requires Flash)
  </a>
</p>

Use the download attribute when linking to a download
When you are linking to a resource that's to be downloaded rather than opened in the browser, you can use the download attribute to provide a default save filename. Here's an example with a download link to the latest Windows version of Firefox:

<a    href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US"
  download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe">
  Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
</a>
